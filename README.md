# Elixir: Towers of Hanoi

An implementation of Towers of Hanoi written in Elixir. When I was learning
elixir, the examples I saw felt ideomatically OO (e.g. [1]) rather than 
functional so I decided to write one myself, leaning into FP.

Having got the CLI running, I didn't stop there and ended up building a 
LiveView web-app because, why not?

Obviously having written this as a critique of structure - feel free to comment on what I have done. All greatfully accepted.

## How to run 

Full details on how to run either as a webapp, gen_server or command line can be [on this page](https://garethwebber.github.io/elixir-tower-hanoi/howtorun.html).
